#### Huge thanks to Aidan, Jason, Misha and Laurin  for helping me figure out why my code wasn't working. Support their repository [here.](https://github.com/Lauringschw/Data-Lab-AP-CSA)

I made some edits to the code as I was given a different question by my teacher so my main method will look different as well as some of my imports. It seems like the U.S. government also changed the weather URLs so I have updated them to do so. I have not done the Open-Ended Activity but feel free to add it if you have done so.
