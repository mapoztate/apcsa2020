#### Huge shoutout to Chris and Alice. Definitely helped me figure out a good chunk of this lab. Support the original repository right [here:](https://github.com/snopiro/CelebrityLabFinal)

The CelebrityTester file as well as some of the other Celebrity classes are missing since that's truly up to you to implement. The CelebrityTester is basically a main method and I provided the LiteratureCelebrity class as an example for the others. If you want some of the earlier activities to run, you'll need to comment out the code that's giving you an error. This is the code in its final form.
